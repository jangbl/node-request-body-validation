# How to run this application

## Running the project

Make sure to install the dependencies with `npm`

You can then run the project by executing

## API

### POST /dev

Expected payload

```
{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "dob": "12-31-1950",
    "countryCode": "US"
